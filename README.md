#Hands on Lab - World of Watson, October 2016

Session Name: From Lab to Production: Scale Up Your Data Science with IBM Data Science Experience

Date: October 25, 2016, 4:00pm - 6:30pm

Place: Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay - Bayside F - 13

Description: Learn how IBM Data Science Experience can be used in early the stages of a data science project to create models that can then be scaled. By making it easy to change Spark instances with Jupyter notebooks or RStudio, Data Science Experience makes it easy to scale up when you are ready.


# Instructions:

#Step 1. Get on IBM Data Science Experience (DSX).
##Create an account.

1.  Go to [http://datascience.ibm.com/](http://datascience.ibm.com/)

3. Type a name for your project. For instance, "DSX Lab". A Spark service and an object storage will be automatically selected as well as a container with a default name. A container is a directory on the object storage. Click on Create.

 > You are now in your new project where you can create notebooks and data assets as well as add collaborators.

#Step 3. Create a new notebook.


 1.  From the your project page, on the "Overview" tab click "add notebook"

 2.  In the next screen named “Create Notebook”, switch to “From File” tab, name the notebook “My Lab”, and choose the notebook file on your disk from the archive: notebooks/FARS_LAB.ipynb

 3. Click on Create Notebook

 4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the hands on exercise
